# flame_orientation
This repository contains a program for detecting wood flames on violin backs, using modified Hough line detection algorithms. These algorithms are implemented in Cython.\
The project's objective, results, and the reasoning behind the developed algorithms are detailed in the paper linked below.\

The Hough line modified algorithms are used and compared in the notebook <ins>test.ipynb</ins>.
